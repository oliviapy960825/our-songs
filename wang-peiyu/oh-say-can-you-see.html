  <h1>Say Can You See</h1>
  <h2>Lana Del Ray</h2>
  <p>Oh say can you see my stars<br />The nighttime is almost ours<br>
     To wander through alleys and look at the bars<br>Nighttime is almost ours<br />
     The headlights from passing cars<br>They illuminate my face then leave me
     in the dark<br>The voice of Nirvana says "come as you are"<br>And I will<br>
     The nighttime is almost ours<br>The swag of the hips and arms<br />we cradle you
     from afar<br> They swing till you're tired and<br> send you to Mars<br>Nighttime is
     almost ours</p>
